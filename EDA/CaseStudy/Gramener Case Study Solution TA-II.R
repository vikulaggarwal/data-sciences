# Data Understanding: 

# If you glance through the meta data, you will find three types of variables: 
# 1. variables related to customers demographics 
# 2. variables related to the loan characteristics
# 3. variables related to the customers behaviour characteristic (after they were granted a loan).

## Customer's Demographic and application variables: 

# emp_title 
# emp_length
# home_ownership
# annual_inc
# verification_status
# addr_state
# zip_code
# title
# purpose
# desc
# url

## Loan related information & characteristics

# loan amount
# funded amount
# funded amount invested
# interest rate
# loan status
# loan grade
# loan sub-grade
# dti
# loan issue date
# loan term
# installment

## Credit information/ Customer Behaviour variables 

#  delinq_2yrs
#  earliest_cr_line
#  inq_last_6mths
#  open_acc
#  pub_rec
#  revol_bal
#  revol_util 
#  total_acc
#  out_prncp 
#  out_prncp_inv
# total_pymnt             
# total_pymnt_inv
# total_rec_prncp

# Business Model 
# How does the lending process work?

# Business Objective
# The company wants to understand the driving factors behind default. 
# If one is able to identify these risky loan applicants,
# then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. 
# Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study. 

###################################################################################################

# Now, think of mapping the business problem with the dataset.The variables related to the customer
# behaviour will not be available at the time of application. 
# Thus analysing these variables is not useful. 

# In general, want to understand the variables that are available
# at the time of the application stage, when only 
# the demographic and loan characteristic variables will be available. 

# So, going forward, we will do the analysis on the remaining two types of variables:

# 1. variables related to customer demographics
# 2. variables related to the loan characteristics

# Hence, it makes sense to narrow down the analysis to these four products 

# Performance
# 1. What has been the overall default rate? 
# 2. What has been the default rate across products?  
# 3. Which time-period does the data belong to? Has the default rate varied over time?

# home improvement 12%, credit cards 11% etc.



# Some products have high lending amount but lower default rates, and vice-versa.
# So how do you decide which products are more 'important'?
# We can take weighted average of % amount lent and default rate

# Credit cards are the second highest, home improvement the third highest
# This is expected, since about 57% of the business comes from
